________________________DJANGO NOTES________________________

Creating Tables:
1. The last step here is to add our new model to our database. First we have to
make Django know that we have some changes in our model. (We have just created
it!) Go to your console window and type python "$ manage.py makemigrations blog".
2. Django prepared a migration file for us that we now have to apply to our
database. Type "$ python manage.py migrate blog" and the output should be as
follows:

Running the server:
"$ python manage.py runserver"
Available at address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

A note on "views":
A view is a place where we put the "logic" of our application. It will request
information from the model you created before and pass it to a template. We'll
create a template in the next chapter. Views are just Python functions that are
a little bit more complicated than the ones we wrote in the Introduction to
Python chapter. Views are placed in the views.py file. We will add our views to
the blog/views.py file.

Useful HTML tags:
<h1>A heading</h1> for your most important heading
<h2>A sub-heading</h2> for a heading at the next level
<h3>A sub-sub-heading</h3> â€¦and so on, up to <h6>
<p>A paragraph of text</p>
<em>text</em> emphasizes your text
<strong>text</strong> strongly emphasizes your text
<br> goes to another line (you can't put anything inside br and there's no closing tag)
<a href="https://djangogirls.org">link</a> creates a link
<ul><li>first item</li><li>second item</li></ul> makes a list, just like this one!
<div></div> defines a section of the page
